# What is it ?
NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework that helps build server-side applications. Nest extends Node.js frameworks like Express or Fastify adding modular organization and a wide range of other libraries to take care of repetitive tasks. It’s open-source, uses TypeScript, and is a very versatile Node.js framework for building backend systems. It helps scale Node.js servers and supports several databases such as MongoDB, Redis, and Apache Cassandra.
